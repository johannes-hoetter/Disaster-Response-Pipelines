# Disaster-Response-Pipelines
Repository containing Source Code for the "Disaster Response Pipelines" Project from the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree

### Project Motivation
This project is part of the curriculum of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. <br>
Aim of this project was to get to know ETL- and ML-Pipelines and how to use them correctly. <br>
The data has been provided by FigureEight.

### Installation
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/messages.csv data/categories.csv data/DisasterMessages.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterMessages.db RandomForestClassifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run the web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to localhost:3001/

### Note
The work on this project will be continued - by now, the deadline for the project submission has arrived and I'm going
to hand in this version. <br>
Things that are still ToDo:
- Optimize Model Classification Results
- Redesign Visualizations (add more significant ones)
- Change Layout of the Pages (custom made with Bootstrap)
- Rewrite the script files using Django, use Angular or React for Frontend
- Deploy on a Web Server
